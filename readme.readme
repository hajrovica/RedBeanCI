Just found out that RedBean plugin which included in this CI is outdated.

So following tutor maded a RedBean library for use.  Last ver of RB used

Load the library like any other

$this->load->library('rb');

Do fun stuff with the beans in your controller:

$album = R::dispense('album');
$album->title = '13 Songs';
$album->artist = 'Fugazi';
$album->year = 1990;
$album->rating = 5;
$id = R::store($album);
